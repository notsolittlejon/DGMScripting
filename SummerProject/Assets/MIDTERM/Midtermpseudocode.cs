In the dead of night, were abducted and left down in a deep dungeon. Oh no. 
You encounter a troll, who somehow got a hold of your beautiful greatsword.
You can 
-Attack (Adds Strength & Defense)
-Run (Adds Strength & Dexterity)
-Charm (Adds Charisma and Intelligence)

If you fail, you lose hp.
(Attack, troll throws you)
(Run, you don't get away. He smacks you and throws you.)
(Charm, unimpressed, he picks you up and throws you)
If you succeed, you gain 1 item (Greatsword, added to Inventory)
(Attack, you hit him and he drops it and runs)
(Run, you steal it and run away)
(Charm, he gives it to you)
-----------------------

After getting past the troll, you continue in the dungeon and find a locked door.
You can:
-Pick the lock (Dexterity & Intelligence)
-Break down the door (Strength, check inventory for sword and add +5 to score if it's there)
-Knock and see who is there (Charisma & Intelligence)

If you fail, you lose hp
(Fail to pick lock, too noisy, guard opens door and it smacks you in the face)
(Fail to break door, guard swings door open and hits you with it)
(Knock and fail, the guard opens the door and hits you with it)

If you succeed: 
-Quietly open door, and proceed
-Break the door in, and proceed

Encounter Three (Switch Statement)
Get past the guard, and out of the dungeon!
-Talk to the guard (Charisma + Intelligence)
-Run past the guard (Dexterity + strength)
-Fight the guard (Strength, check inventory for sword and add +5 to score if it's there)

if you 
fail, lose hp
(fail to charm guard, he attacks you and you have to run. if dexterity is too low, he hits you as you run past)
(fail to run past him, he hits you as you go by)
(fail when fighting him, test defense and he does damage if your dexterity is too low)

if you succeed, 
-Guard opens the gate and lets you out of the dungeon
-You run past the guard, open the gate and flee the dungeon
-You defeat the guard and he opens the gate for you

Along the line, if you lose too much hp, you DIE.
